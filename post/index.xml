      <description>I am mikkosec, welcome to my blog. I work as a telecommunications engineer for the US Army and have worked different IT roles in the civilian world for the past 10 years. Although I am currently coursing my bachelorâ€™s degree in Cybersecurity at WGU, most of my tech knowledge comes from self-study and following tutorials online.
My goal is to become one of the top ten bug bounty hunters in the world.</description>
